## Features

- Measures user’s typing speed (words per minute or characters per minute)  
- Real‑time feedback while typing  
- Simple, clean UI  
- Client‑side only (no server required)  
- Easily modifiable (text, timer, styling etc.)

---

## How It Works

- Presents the user with a predetermined text to type.  
- Tracks time from when typing starts until finish or timeout.  
- Calculates typing speed (e.g. WPM) based on the number of correct words/characters and elapsed time.  
- Displays results (speed, accuracy if implemented).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)  
- Basic knowledge of HTML / JavaScript if you want to modify it  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ckhamitkar/typing-speed.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd typing-speed
   ```

3. (Optional) If you want a local server for better testing (for example to avoid CORS or local file issues), you can use something like:

   ```bash
   # with Python 3
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

   Or any simple static server.

### Usage

- Open `index.html` in your browser.  
- Start typing in the provided text area when prompted.  
- Your typing speed is calculated after you finish or reach the timer limit.  
- Review the results.
